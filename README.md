# Some exact results on Lindley process with Laplace jumps
Here we provide the codes to generate analyitical results as decribed in [cit]


  To run the code for the analysis of the position density:

    1-download all the folders

    2-open with MATLAB: code4article/position/position_sim_empVSteo.m

    3-initialize parameters in the first section of the script, and RUN.


 To run the code for the analysis of the stopping probability:

    1-download all the folders

    2-open with MATLAB: code4article/stopping/stopping_sim_empVSteo.m

    3-initialize parameters in the first section of the script, and RUN.
